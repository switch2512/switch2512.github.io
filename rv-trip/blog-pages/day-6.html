                Day 6 - Saturday May 14th
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Last night we went to bed to the sound of rain. We woke up to the sound of rain. We drove for hours in the rain. It was very rainy. After just about 24 hours of constant rain it eased up just enough for our dayâ€™s activities. Our first stop was the Vista House. A panoramic view point built in 1917. It was amazing to see pictures of cars over 100 years old visiting the same spot we were standing at.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We drove down a scenic route parallel to the columbia river gorge, stopping at waterfalls along the way. There were a few showers during our lunch that made us hesitate before setting out on Beacon Rock trail. After conquering 800ft in elevation we laid eyes on what seemed like the entirety of the gorge. The rainy weather in Washington and Oregon make for an incredibly green backdrop.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It was on our way towards our overnight spot when we realized we had been through every conceivable climate on our RV trip. We passed through the snowy Crater Lake, the rainy Columbia River Gorge, windy eastern Oregon, and were now driving into 80 degrees crossing into Idaho.
