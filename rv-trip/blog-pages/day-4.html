            <p>Day 4 - Thursday May 12th
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                For one of the very few times on this trip, the day’s exploration wasn’t going to be under the open sky. Instead, most of today was going to be spent in caverns - Shasta Caverns to be exact.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We started our excursion by parking near Shasta Lake, a man-made lake created with the intention of managing droughts in surrounding areas. This may make it sound like a pond but this lake, established in 1944, covers an area of 30,000 acres! There were several previously inhabited towns in this 30,000 acres that were consequently submerged in water.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After dodging a group of 100 screaming children, we boarded a boat to cross Lake Shasta. Next, we took a bumpy ride in a bus up a narrow one lane dirt road. I’ve done this a few times before so I wasn’t nervous until I learned the 18 year kid in front of us was the driver. Once at the top we finally got to enter the caves.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                These caverns were initially discovered in 1944 and have since been expanded to allow for easy touring. Stalactites, stalagmites and all the other cave formations form over many, many years, completely devoid of light, movement and human interaction. All three of these things are now daily occurrences and can significantly impact the caves. Our tour guide was a big proponent for cave conservation so I asked him how he could be comfortable doing these tours knowing their impact. HIs response intrigued me. He said there are many other beautiful caves around Lake Shasta and they hope to cut down on people exploring them by essentially sacrificing this cave to tours.

                Before settling into our long drive that evening we stopped at McArthur-Burney Falls. It was a beautiful waterfall with some very interesting attributes. One that stuck out to Grace and I was the fact that the mist from the waterfall allowed for a unique ecosystem not normally found in this climate. Plants could grow here that were normally only found in humid and rainy climates. It was beautiful and we were thankful that it was a short hike after a long day of spuddleplunking.
