                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We woke bright and early to the sounds of mooing and the smell of dung... ok, not really but it was bakersfield so we were excited to get back on the road. Yosemite lay ahead!

                It took  3.5 hours in Whistling Wendy to reach the national park. Once in the park, all attention was on the skys - they had been narrowed by the massive expanses of rock stretching into the sky. After a lecture from the park ranger for not signing my park pass, we were at our first stop, Bridal Veil Falls. This is a very common name for a waterfall but it was anything but common. It was beautiful. A torrential, roaring veil of white turbulence. Unfortunately, both Halfdome and Bridal Veil Falls were closed for remodeling. Who knew natural wonders required so much upkeep.  Oh well, we moved onto our next hike.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                One of the hikes we had planned was the John Muir and Mist Trail loop. A 6 mile hike with a beautiful view of Half Dome. At least that's what I've been told. I had vastly over-estimated my endurance at this grade of incline so instead we stopped at Vernal Falls. This was another amazing waterfall. This waterfall was much broader than the last and looked like a never ending crashing wave.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As we got closer to the cascading wall of water we quickly came to understand why it was called Mist Trail. The water pounding the rocks threw tiny droplets into the air that rained down all over the steep, makeshift stoney staircase. We conquered the treacherous pathway, took a victorious selfie and headed back down the trail to complete our hike of 1,000ft in elevation and 4.5 miles.
