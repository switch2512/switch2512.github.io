                Day 7 - Sunday May 15th
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Today was a driving day. We drove and we drove a lot. We are doing something that has never before been done by the Gietzens; we are doing both the coast and the inland routes in one trip. To connect these two normally separate trips we had to traverse the entirety of Idaho - our soon to be home state! The highlight of our day was driving past our new home and trying to imagine just pulling the RV right into the garage!
