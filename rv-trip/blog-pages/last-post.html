              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Does anyone know what -1 degrees celsius is in Fahrenheit? Whatever it is, it's cold! The only thing that made getting out of bed possible was the knowledge that our diesel engine would warm up quickly and heat us up with it. Even though our day started at 30 degrees Fahrenheit it ended at 72!
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Our day today was based around Sacramento, the capital of California. After a full day here I can confidently say that it embodies all of California's ideals.
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Due to Covid all indoor tours of the capital building were cancelled. Instead, Grace and I took a tour of the Capital Garden. The capital garden was created with a Victorian theme and has kept that theme ever since. One of the trends was to collect trees from all around the world as a display of wealth. There have been many additions since such as a grove made up of trees from different civil war battle fields.
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The tour ended at the doors of the capital building where a small group of protesters were yelling about prison communities. We skirted past them and happened to run into a Santa Fe Christian tour group from our old High School! What are the odds?
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              After exploring the echoing halls and massive rotunda, we paid our respects to the looming picture of the terminator and former president Ronald Reagan.
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              English people like to walk, I know that now. We walked several miles from the capital building to the Sacramento History Museum. Here we learned a lot about the gold rush and the checkered past of Sacramento. One of the interesting things that stuck out to Grace was the letters written from immigrants back home to their loved ones. They were obviously written from the heart and it was palpable even this far into the future. Something I found intriguing was the canning machine they had preserved in the exhibit as well as the histroy of hallow sidewalks built tens of feet off the ground to avoid flood waters.
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
              We left the museum with a 2.5 hour drive ahead and new perspective on California politics.
