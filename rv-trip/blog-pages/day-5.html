                Day 5 - Friday May 13th
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Today was so beautiful we didn’t even realize it was Friday the 13th. We set off towards Crater Lake after an eerie warning from the RV Park manager that it was a dangerous journey. We made it safely, of course, but if we had left just 24 hours earlier we would’ve been turned away from the national park due to heavy snowfall!
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even in mid May there were banks of snow more than 10 feet high! It wasn’t until we were in their visitor’s center that we learned this is completely normal. They have an average 40ft of snow every winter, most of which sticks around until late spring.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The lake itself was beautiful. The snow dampened all sound but the wind and blanketed everything in white. We trekked through the snow, sinking into it with every step, to get a few pictures. We had lunch in their cafe and were lucky enough to catch one more viewpoint they had cleared while we were eating.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The rest of the day was driving with the exception of a gas stop. This stop was different from the rest because we found out something very strange about Oregon. When the attendants saw us filling up at the pump they frantically came out to us and asked if we were pumping gas or diesel. Confused, we told them we didn’t need any help. They insisted. Gas or diesel? Shortly after the confusing exchange they explained that it is illegal to pump your own gas in Oregon. I kid you not. Shocked, Grace and I looked up why this could possibly be. According to the internet, and they have never once lied to me, Oregon doesn’t trust their citizens to pump their own gas. Instead, they have the minimum wage high school student do it for you!
