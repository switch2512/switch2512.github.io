            <p>Day 1 - Monday May 9th
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Monday May 9th started off well with the RV rental company calling us to let us know we could pick up the RV early! Great, we thought, we could pick up the RV and start packing it ahead of schedule. Up to this point we had been idly moving our things back and forth across the room in anticipation for our trip.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                It was a good thing we got packing early as it took much longer than anticipated. In reality, Grace did all the packing. I packed a few changes of clothes and felt ready for adventure. Grace on the other hand had the forethought to think about things like soap and toilet paper - both of which I would be very grateful for shortly.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The first stop on our trip was the Gietzen house - the Encinitas Gietzens. With the sun sinking we powered through a carb filled dinner of pizza and garlic knots then hit the road. This stint would end up being over 4 hours. Our destination? A walmart. Not for more toilet paper, not yet at least, but for a good night's sleep. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Believe it or not, Walmart is fairly well known for letting roadtrippers spend the night in their parking lots. However, we found out the hard way that this is only true for a most Walmarts. The rest of the Walmarts have to break the bad news to hopeful travelers. The security guard, who was used to dealing with the grumpies late at night, was surprised to find Grace and I were quite amiable; He let slip that there was a corner of the parking lot that he may forget to patrol.
